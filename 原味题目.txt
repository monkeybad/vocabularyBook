Oracle has begun the source, the
review of the code, although as you
can understand, a complicated
project that will take time for us to
finish the details.

The content growth team performed
a series of critical optimizations on
the functionality, strategies and
algorithms.

UG is responsible for providing
referral checks and using referral
programs to attract more new users
and enhance the fun of the event.

ByteDance has 5 board members, 3
of them are American.

This is how we pull the messages on
the client side.

A lot of policymakers that prior were
very skeptical of us are now coming
out in favor, opposing a ban and
understanding where we are.

The photo is captured from both
selfie camera and the backside
camera simultaneously.

The content growth team aims at
increasing content diversity, quality
and brand perception of TikTok.

Our goal is to increase the overall
publish rate by 9.6% from AB test.

First, we have our creator growth
team, whose mission is to help 
creators grow and achieve their
goals. 

Now as TikTok has grown, we've tried
to learn the lessons of companies that have come before us, especially when it comes to the safety of
teenagers.

Why take that tack? How do you think
you can fight this from a legal
perspective?

Is it a coin operated laundry place or
is it like a dry cleaning place?

How far in advance do have to book?

So we will start from talking about
the current state of our service and
then we will go through the ideas of
optimization. 

We do have 2 team members inside
TTP that can do the analysis and give
us detailed information if it's
necessary.

Still, we have heard important
concerns about the potential for
unwanted foreign access to US data
and potential manipulation of the
TikTok US ecosystem.


What do you make of this almost
deglobalization that's occurring in
technology? 

You can't just read it and see what
it's gonna do. It's a gigantic file of
inscrutable numbers.

I was gonna ask do you have any
recommendation for this area for a
quick bite? 

I think we need another minute to
decide, if that's okay.

It's much more restricted than the
underfourteen experience in China.
It's so restrictive that every single
piece of content is vetted by our third
party child safety expert.

It's unique cooking methods and
colorful ingredients are very
reminiscent of the jolly bustling life in
Szechuan. 

We believe that in order to achieve
our mission and our vision, and of
course, all the OKRs that I shared, we
need everyone to consistently
practice our ByteStyle. 

He doesn't have access to other
benefits because we book through a
third party and not directly through
his account. 

The most popular is the traditional
afternoon tea with the pastries,
scones and sandwiches and the tea.

So when you filter, you can remove
certain pages from your list.

You are mainly responsible for
recording the false alarms that ready
occur and escalating the real alarms
to be solved. 

Right now, it's our highest priority to
address these problems.

So figuring out how we manage that
is, l think kind of mission critical for
the people who want integrity of our
democracy. 

Then we're actually utilizing this
feature to actually do the message
pulling. 

And the fourth one is transparency
and third party monitoring. So the
way we are trying to address this
concern is an unprecedented amount
of transparency.

But I can confidently say that my life
is fuller and more meaningful as a
result of my decision.

So humility is not a bad thing, being
low-key is not necessarily a bad
thing. 

However, first timers here will often
be completely overwhelmed by this
complicated system. 

I think we offer a chance to create
common ground in a world where
people feel isolated and alone.

Truly a foodie's paradise, and just
walking through it feels fattening.

So this is a quick summary of the
feature owner responsibilities.

This avoids long messages from
being chopped into multiple pieces.

Your company has just decided to sue
the state of Montana in the United
States. 

Now that you've built up your own live
community, how to engage with them
through live subscription?

They've obtained the proper
approvals and security permissions
from the user. 

I'm guessing our host is going to stuff
her face with a lot of calories.

If you're not really sure, then you can
just leave a comment.

But normally he wouldn't notice it
cause I don't think the user can recall
a few thousand conversations on his
apps. 

They could understand the whole
SOP and the current situation.

The point I'm trying to make is to
encourage you to embrace the
journey you are going to embark on.

So after investigation, we saw the
opportunity to decrease unnecessary
messages for account risk
notification by simply shortening our
SMS template.

Hi, sorry to bug you guys, can you
guys take one for me over here, too?

Because it needs to go through the
DES synchronization part.

By working in lockstep with the
businesses, we can take this brand to
not only a level of trust, but a level of
emotional connection.

And we believe that we have taken
steps there above and beyond what
our industry has done to protect the
safety of US user data, which is very
important. 

We want to be a socially responsible
partner, empower and support the
local communities.

My main point is that the standard
run of business elements are
deprioritized for most part due to
lack of resources.

Is everything on the blackboard
served for breakfast or only certain
things? 

So there's only 2 main use cases. One
is for gaming and the other one is for media publishers and E-Commerce.

Finally, we have our open platform,
which is focused on acquiring professional creators and developers outside of TikTok using third parties.

And after serving in Singapore's
military, I moved to the UK to attend
college and then here to the US to
attend business school.

Would you guys mind helping me do
the like deshelling the lobster,
cracking it open?

Now, that's what we've been doing
for the last 2 years, building what
amounts to a firewall, the seals of
protected US user data from
unauthorized foreign access.

With these 2 features, we further
improve the user experience when
there was a typo in user's input and
also made positive impacts on our
success metrics.

Actually, the first bite was really
good. If you take more bites, it gets
kind of salty. 

We must rise to this new challenge
together. Now, the stakes are very
high, but our ambitions are even
higher. 

I just got this from the souvenir shop.
You can have it.

The idea here is to let users receive a
random daily notification at the exact
same time as their friends, instead of
a 3-minute limit to take a real-time
photo.

The change was actually lightweight,
didn't take up many resources, but we achieved a considerable benefit.

If our creators see, oh they can get
traffic in this way, and they are all
going to do. 

A question for you related to X
platform. Are there simple things we
can do, especially when it comes to
visual media? 

The onboarding special project
brought solid growth to our Day-one
retention. 

If the data shows that our users
wouldn't stay in the inbox space for a
long time, then we must keep
implementing this mechanism.

A lot of the progress in AI in general is
making that kind of content
moderation capabilities a lot better.

So basically these are all scenarios
that the clients will pull the message.

The next stage is to really scale up
the content supply through the top
creators, their influences, word of
mouth... 

It will list all the reviews pages in
chronological order.

We could do this by amplifying the
content of certain troublemaking
disturbing people, causing
uncertainties, spreading
misinformation, etc.

Secondly, we have the creator
monetization team under us with the
mission to help and reward TikTok
creators for content creation on our
platform.

We're animals with a prefrontal
cortex. That's how I think of us. We
have these addictive instincts that go
back millions of years.

This mind-blowing Transformer
adventure puts you in the middle of
the ultimate war zone.

We have a task force that Jason is
leading to figure out some remedies.

I remember struggling with this
decision, wondering if this decision
would enhance or delay my career.

I worked hard with what I had. I put
myself out there and I took chances
when they came.

If you wanna order black pudding or
hash browns, that will be extra.

In fact, we should stick to the facts
and we should make sure that we are
always abiding by being candid and 
very clear. 

It's a private company, 60% of the
company is owned by global
institutional investors, 20% is owned
by the founder and 20% owned by
employees around the world.

The thing that we have to be quite
familiar with is the escalation of
procedure cost.

If you pretend to understand
something that you don't, that's
called being clever.

In the interest of time, think we
would have to do it ourselves.

Like many of you, I made some
amazing lifelong friends from around
the world during my time at UCL.

We will have profound artificial
intelligence and obviously at a level
that far exceeds human intelligence.

And what it really is, is to ensure that
American data is stored on American soil by an American company and overseen by American personnel.

I just want to make it very clear that
you're both supposed to be familiar
with using monitoring, using all the
tools at your disposal to solve
problems.

So right now, you got some ideas of
how our message delivery works.
Then we can start talking about how
we can improve this message
delivery.

I thought it would be entirely fatty
and greasy, but actually it's pretty
dry and fragrant.

We have built and kept iterating
multiple capabilities which uphold
and keep improving our user journey
and ultimately facilitate business
growth.

I think that this has been handed over
to the moderation team.

Minced pork clings to the vermicelli
looking just like ants crawling on tree
branches, hence the intriguing name.

I see most of the questions have been
answered, so I was wondering is
there any particular questions.

It'll certainly grow by an order of
magnitude next year.

Those are things that we're trying to
work on pretty proactively, but we
basically get the same feedback,
which is not enough people to work
on things. 

The local team can give us more local
insight to build more gifts.

But what the quality members are the
ones who are mainly responsible for
building the dashboards, making sure
that the alarms are calibrated
properly.

We can look at a few different priority levels.

They are also very soon about to
launch paid content in southeast
Asia, which they worked on very hard
in the last bimonth.

In the future, you might need to
extract it as a common component.

So that's why we actually involved
the risk control team to build the
whole process and SOP with us.

Our mission is to provide the best
personalized experience in the
industry. 

This eliminates the concern that
some of you have shared with me that
TikTok user data can be subject to
Chinese law. 

Do you guys mind taking a picture for
me over here by the minion?

The account can have multiple
purposes, as long as they have the
same audience.

Our approach has never been to
dismiss or trivialize any of these
concerns. We have addressed them
with real action. 

You can choose to look at a map
and/or seek a passer-by for help.

Tapas are these small appetizer or
snack things, but in a lot of Spanish
culture (it) has evolved to be a
delicate cuisine.

I should just wait around for them to fix it up?

I'm glad that I did choose to go
despite my own uncertainties, as it
was there that I met my wife.

I'm going to start a timer for about 2
minutes.

So I think ultimately, it is about
providing value to these users and
making sure that we continue to
provide them with a great service
that benefits them.

I think the most important thing is
one, they have tools and two, 
creators can make money. There's
only 2 things that we do for games.

So you can use this to find out where
the errors are.

If you hate someone, buy them a car
in New York City. The sky high
parking rates and endless traffic jams
will frustrate them to death.

The key issue that many would have
is data, and the anxiety that
ultimately the Chinese government
can have access to US user data.

They open up into GitLab, so that
they can approve your requirement.

If we can land all four of these and
articulate it to external audiences and
really get this right, that solves so
many of our issues.

And know that your professors will be
cheering you on and your friends and
family will be supporting you along
the way. 

They can be very useful for
debugging or finding out whether this
is related to the latest release.

By default, all US data is stored in the
Oracle Cloud Service already, in the
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

But Project Texas is a very
complicated project. And a lot a of the
elements of the project are already in
place and operational.

I think I'll need a little help picking out
one.

If you understand but you pretend not
to, that's called wisdom.

The change was actually lightweight,
didn't take up many resources, but
we achieved a considerable benefit.

The world is changing quickly and
there are always new situations that 
you're not going to be familiar with.

I do echo this point. First of all, the
mission of the company is very clear.

Is that Swiss cheese in there? Just a
few of those.

I'm not a huge alcohol person, SO
maybe like a soft drink or whatever
you guys have.

The team will be expanding these
launches to new countries in the next
bimonth. 

We might skip the video, so you can
watch yourself.

So what are we doing today?
Although I'm super jet lagged.

Let's keep it up and continue to make
good things happen.

I think it deserves more discussion or
analysis about the latest data of this
week. 

Now, what really makes TikTok very
unique and very different is the whole
discovery engine behind us.

I think it's a good opportunity for us
to explain ourselves because there
are some myths and misconceptions
about our company out there. 

Building your own live community is
all about staying connected and
shortening the distance between you
and your viewers.

If I don't want certain items, can |
substitute them for other items?

So there're certain configurations we
can make from the server side.

He tries to reinstall the apps and then
he needs to initialise the DM
conversation. 

How to continuously create user
value is something challenging and 
we will always need to keep in mind
as we iterate our product.

So you definitely have identified early
just how with social creatures, we
need affirmation.

I spent over two decades working for
a traditional media company, one that
was globally iconic and revered and
brand focused.

So within reason, the toothbrush and
the toothpaste amounts are
complementary too, right?

She said the line was really long. She
said it's worth the wait, though.

So this made it difficult for third party
engineers to integrate with our APIs,
and it started causing bugs and
issues. 

There seems to be some bipartisan
agreement around TikTok and what is
perceived as the danger of it.

We have built over the last two years
something we call internally Project
Texas. 

I didn't really have any investing
experience then, but kept trying to
learn and pushed myself to leave my
comfort zone. 

Well, really anything that can be
actuated by a computer is effectively
a robot. 

When it's properly done, the food is
covered by red chili pepper oil and
chili pepper oil is key to the signature
smell of the dish. 

Everything in the world is about
business, money, jewelry, cultural
relics.

We got some feedback from some of
the top consumers, saying that
they're waiting for the next cheap
recharging channel.

We already explored the optimization
strategy for low end devices.

Open only on Saturdays,
Smorgasburg offers freshly prepared
hot foods.

I met many internet founders during
this journey, including the founding
team of ByteDance and TikTok.

I think it's somewhat inevitable
there'll be some amount of open
source, and I guess I would have a
slight bias towards open source.

Actually, we only selected the top
creators to treat them as a master to
share some experience.

In the past bimonth, we ran about 110
experiments on TikTok.

If you cannot find the root cause of
the issue, you have to report to your
leader. 

I think it was a very important
process and I'm very grateful for the
opportunity to show up and to tell our
side of the story.

Half of our moderation team is based
in Canada, where culturally their
willingness of hand rolled cigarettes
of tobacco is not common, so it's
being mistaken for legal substance.

And this is truly an unprecedented
project that none of the other
companies in our industry have ever
attempted. 

In this project, users are allowed to
customize their effect based on
templates and publish the effect.

What we have done is that we have
created an extraordinary space
where inclusion and acceptance are
the norm. 

Originally, this callback is to design to
actually let them receive the
notification.

For decades, you've had thousands
of brilliant creative people toiling in
the trenches, trying to imagine stuff
that will be amazing for an audience.

I recommend that you just continue
adding onto this, so that we can make
it easier for people to find all these
things. 

I recommend that if in future you
encounter any more bugs, just pin 
me. 

Even if you were to weigh it, we
usually use pound instead of kilo.

I think we have all seen the benefits
of a very connected global internet
over the last few decades.

Last bimonth, they launched new
data access control measures to
better protect the sensitive data of
TikTok users with external
developers.

It's very easy for us to keep track of
all the deployments that we have.

The problem that we have can really
require third party verification and it
requires transparency.

If all China-based employee will lose
access to our creators' revenue
history, it's going to be a big impact.

We're in an era of techlash where
people don't trust tech platforms,
and particularly us. We are at a
deficit. 

If you have an allergy or dietary
requirements, I'm very happy to
amend it. 

Three key issues to highlight that
think are related to most of the
questions, one is around overkill.

But as I mentioned, the efficiency is
actually lower than our expectations
and we hope that we can finish the
whole process within the next 3 days.

I do think there is a safety concern,
especially with humanoid robots.

This is a case about how you can use
false alarms.

Hi, everyone. My name is Shou and
I'm honored to have the opportunity
to speak with you today.

We have a suite of family pairing tools
so that parents can participate in
their teens' experiences and make
the choices that are right for their
families. 

I want to align or consolidate as many
accounts as possible. Because it 
doesn't make any sense to maintain
different accounts for different
teams. 

Global DAU growth actually exceeded
expectations with an increase of over
20% in the past year.

I think that we need to
simultaneously address the concerns
about and the desire for digital
sovereignty while making sure that
we don't break the internet.

We highly encourage all the members
in order to help us co-build this
knowledgebase.

Only vetted personnel operating in a
new company called TikTok Us Data
Security can control access to this
data. 

What do we do to protect businesses,
consumers and that they trust this
technology better, and how do we
bring them along that journey with
us? 

While we are in a very difficult
political environment, the needle has been moving in a positive direction.

The mission of our value chain is to
build a creator-centric system. So we
can continue to grow TikTok's
content and ecosystem with our
creators.

There are many other kinds of fresh
seafood, all of which are very
enticing. 

That's why she is now shelling out on
a hotel room for us.

So it's a form of collaborative filtering
from what you're saying.

I think it's the same reason because
of the limitation of the resources, not
just the moderators' resources, but
also even for the machines'
resources. 

To achieve these goals, we made
some great progress over the last
bimonth. I'Il briefly go over our teams
and their achievements.

It's a universal high income, which is
a nice phrase and it's good from a
kind of materialistic sense of
abundance.

The 3rd one is to safely empower
internal partners and external
developers with API, SDK tools, etc.

Sometimes you will have to leave your
comfort zone and you will feel 
uncertain and uncomfortable. That is
okay. 

So now it is mandatory in New York
law that you have fire escape ladders
outside the buildings.

When will Oracle be able to enact this
sort of unprecedented overseeing
and transparency of your company?

Building additional data access
protocols but adapted for GDPR
which is the regulation within the EU.

I've noticed that some of our creators
have also filed a separate lawsuit
challenging the same Bill in the
courts.

What are the array of things that you
have noticed that you can actually
track that provide useful clues?

The biggest issue that we have is
around smoking and banning
smoking illegal substances.

See whether he'll end up stealing the
show or surrendering and hanging his
head in shame. 

So do we have any specific plan from
TnS to control this kind of content
since it's illegal here?

I still vividly remember sitting in your
seat 16 years ago as a graduate of the
economics department.

Now, it's no secret that we are
subjected to a very high level of
scrutiny around the world.

As we said many times, the Chinese
government has actually never asked us for US user data and we will not
provide it even if asked.

Are there also some high level
creators? They would like to produce
high quality content.

In the effect area, we want to ensure
high quality execution and on-time 
delivery of mobile effect templates.

We keep thinking outside of box and
keep trying different things.

We can see that the monthly data is
already below, it decreased to less
than 10%. 

On the left you can see the creator
edited caption features, which allows
editors to edit the captions that we
automatically generate for them.

Are there unlimited refills on the tea
and snacks?

Bill Gates said there is no one in our
time who has done more to push the
bounds of science innovation than
you. 

The only alternative milks that we
have are almond milk and oat milk.

You actually need to use filtering and
grouping in order to identify the
source of the issue.

Oracle will have unprecedented
access to your data, or indeed to your
source code, but that's not now.

Being at UCL and living in London
gave me a diverse and international
experience. 

And in this bimonth, we should see a
positive gain again for this metric.

It also contains core features of
editing videos, such as modifying
video clips, converting landscape
video into portrait one, changing title,
selecting cover image and applying
templates.

I would have no way to prove if my
career would have been better if had
taken another path.

With the help of AI technology,
teacher Guo can also become a good
English teacher.

Actually, the level of sophistication of
the algorithms you have going is just
another order of magnitude to what
competitors like Facebook or
YouTube have going.

So maybe you can come up with a
solid plan about what are the things
to monitor. 

Every member should actually have a
basic understanding of Argos.

The internet is really built on this idea
of global interoperability and the idea
that talent from around the world can
connect very seamlessly with each
other. 

Every team member should be able to
use Slardar to debug online issues.

So now I'd like to take some time to
highlight a couple of projects our
teams worked on during the last
bimonths. 

Because they want to ban the use of
TikTok for all users by January the
1st, 2024.

One of the things that we want to do
to help solve this is to really start to
talk about the monetization
opportunities for creators.

Then we can actually distribute this
message pulling workload from the
cold start. 

We amplify voices SO that everyone
can feel heard. We provide visibility
so everyone can be seen. We
empower entrepreneurs to build their
dreams. 

Life will take you in many directions.
Work hard to make the most of what
you have. 

After graduation, I didn't really know
what I wanted to do or where life
would take me. In hindsight, there
was no big plan.

Any tourist traps that you knew or
think we should avoid?

In my case, those were the times
found myself learning and developing
the most. 

Today you're going to pretend to be
an annoying customer.

Take chances that will come your
way, but don't overthink it.

I think we'll reap the rewards of that
by continuing to put our users at the
heart of everything we do.

The second is, all these data
sovereignty plans that we have built 
as part of our trust-building exercise 
are unprecedented. It is frankly very
expensive.

But the probability of it going bad is
not 0% . We just need to mitigate the
downside potential.

Here are some useful metrics that
you can look at.

In order to help creators post long
videos more conveniently and
efficiently, we provided tools for
creators to divide video.

If we stay true to the truth, then
think we'll find that people use the
system to learn what is going on.

We were hoping to crack a little
window at night to get some fresh air.

So for US, generally we're seeing a
slowdown in growth.

No matter what you encounter. Have
confidence that the skills and
knowledge you've acquired will
you through.

What we did was we built an
unprecedented project where we
localize American data to be stored
on American soil by an American
company, overseen by American
personnel.

I wanted to take a few moments today
to share a few things I've learned on
my own journey.

Let me start by addressing a few
misconceptions about ByteDance, of
which we are a subsidiary.

This work has also laid a solid
foundation for the rollout of trends in
more countries and regions across
the world. 

What's interesting is we're seeing the
percentage of revenue from UK based
host rising. 

Claudia is now going to look for the
guest house we booked on Airbnb.

I'll start with a quick reminder of our
team structure.

Each week, Katz's serves 6800 kg of
pastrami, 3600 kg of corned beef,
910 kg of salami and 4000 hot dogs.

You can see the number is more than
double, thanks to the great work from
all of our teams.

If we're cognizant and careful about
the bad part on balance, actually it
will be the future that we want.

As you pointed out, we very recently
filed a lawsuit to challenge this in the
courts and we are confident that we
will prevail. 

Client side can display more
messages. They will trigger another
message pull. So I think we can do
some optimization for this case by
case. 

Then you're mainly responsible for
just checking if your MR is present.

We can support our Ops to do the
distribute action in the global portal.

Kevin, our self-proclaimed coffee
expert, is going to make a coffee run
for someone. 

With the help of Al technology,
teacher Guo can also become a good
English teacher.

So what happens after this is that we
will enter the in-house release.

You guys have vinegar too? Just a
little bit of that.

Subscription goal is a great way to
interact with your live community.

When we roll out features like family
pairing and show that we can really
be a responsible platform, that's the
most impactful thing.

Here is the list of the people who are
involved in each function.

We want TikTok to be a place where
teenagers can come to learn, which is
why we recently launched a feed that
exclusively features educational
videos about STEM.

Besides, we have also done some
projects to reduce SMS cost and
some projects to improve
monetizable PII coverage, which will
then contribute to our ad revenue.

It'Il certainly grow by an order of
magnitude next year.

When the user opens the apps, which
is considered as a cold start, then the
client will actually pull the messages.

The kind gentleman not only agreed
to our request, but also offered us an
exclusive afternoon tea balcony.

Obviously, creating a company is sort
of a high-risk-high-reward situation.

These have greatly enhanced the
quality and supply volume of trending events and videos, and it resulted in noticeable improvement on the core
metrics.

TikTok itself is not available in
mainland China. We're headquartered
in Los Angeles and in Singapore.

Can I have the 6-inch with, let's
flat bread?

One of our primary contributions to
the app is to automatically generate captions and translations for videos.

We find ourselves caught in the
middle of geopolitical tensions that
are beyond our control.

As a company, our goal is not to
optimize and maximize time spent. It
is not. 

So once the root cause of the
problem has been found, they get to
the recovery stage.

So I guess they will change the status
today, so that you can go
initial review.

If I don't want certain items, can I
substitute them for other items?

So they want to ensure the stability of
Arena platform.

The underground of New York is
pretty much empty, and you can get
anywhere. (It's) super convenient,
budget friendly. So not that much
complain, I guess.

Before I joined TikTok, I spent my
career in traditional entertainment.
There were two commonalities to the
experiences that I had.

So our TikTok API for external
developers was originally split from
Douyin's open APIs.

We'll also build the end-to-end
mobile effect publishing and
moderation flow.

They also added improvements to
their analytic capabilities for
advanced insights into video views.

And the second one is to provide an
open platform to expand the TikTok
experience beyond the TikTok apps
and enrich TikTok community.

There is a limitation. For example,
this callback cannot be processed
after 30 seconds.

We will continuously improve the
security, performance, video quality
and user experience of TikTok

leading. 

That's why we're giving
unprecedented access to third parties to come in and monitor and
hold us accountable for all the

the user video creation experience and publish rate by optimizing key
components before, during and after
publishing. 

For now, it's mostly collection of the
scattered information from the team,

We are building our data centers in
Ireland, in Norway, localizing the
storage of data in Europe.
